# About the data

There are several data sets in the data:

- `cuttlefish`: occurrences of giant cuttlefish; links to weather and tourism by `stnid`
- `tourism`: quarterly counts of different types of tourism, holiday, visiting family, business, other; links to weather by `stnid`
- `weather`: daily min and max temperature records
- `oz_lga`: spatial polygon map of Australian local government areas (LGAs) 
- `stations`: weather station id's and spatial coordinates matching the occurrence data, `stnid` is key for linking data sets.
