The goal of ecotourism is to provide data to use for example analyses. It has data on wild life (cuttlefish) occurrences, tourism counts by region and weather matching the locations.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ecotourism from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("numbats/ecotourism")
```

## Example

Here is how to plot occurrences:

```{r example}
library(ecotourism)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
data(oz_lga)
data(cuttlefish)
ggplot(oz_lga) +
  geom_sf(colour="white", fill="grey90") +
  geom_point(data=cuttlefish, aes(x=lon, y=lat,
                                  label=date),
             colour="#EA6900", alpha=0.5) +
  xlim(c(113.09, 153.38)) +
  ylim(c(-43.38, -10.41)) +
  theme_map()
```
